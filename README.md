# University Events Platform

## Overview
The **University Events Platform** is a centralized solution for managing university events such as hackathons, workshops, guest lectures, and seminars. It streamlines event communication by integrating timetable management, personalized notifications, a project repository, skill assessment quizzes, and a chatbot for technical guidance.

## Features
- **Event Centralization**: Automatically extracts and organizes event data from university email accounts using **IMAP** and Google Generative AI.
- **Personalized Notifications**: Notifies users about events that fit their free time by cross-referencing their schedules.
- **Event Filtering**: Allows users to filter events by date, type, and time.
- **Project Repository**: Enables students to log and track their academic or personal projects.
- **Skill Assessment Module**: Offers coding and technical quizzes with real-time feedback.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Provides instant technical assistance and event-related FAQs using **Chatbase.co**.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: RESTful API development.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing event, project, and user data.
- **imaplib (Python)**: Email parsing and data extraction.

### Frontend
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**: Interactive user interface.

### AI Tools
- **Google Generative AI**: For cleaning and structuring email data.
- **Chatbase.co**: For chatbot integration.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed. ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **MongoDB** database (local or Atlas).
- **Python 3.x** for email parsing.

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-events-platform.git
   cd university-events-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<dbname>
   PORT=3000
   EMAIL_USERNAME=<university_email>
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=<email_password>
   ```

4. **Run the backend:**
   - For development:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For production:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **Run the email extraction script (Python):**
   ```bash
   python extract_emails.py
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
